## Overview

The Spotify Setlist Maker is a Python script that, when given a musical artist's name, will scrape their latest setlist, including cover songs, from setlist.fm and add them to a custom setlist on your personal Spotify account

## Getting Started

First, you need to get your API keys from Spotify and [Setlist.fm](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html).
